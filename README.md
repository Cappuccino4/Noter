# Noter
A notes application that applies to everyday life as an at-home student! Take a look!


Welcome to Noter! Instead of openign up a file, creating a new word document, titling the document, creating the MLA heading
for the document, Noter will do it all for you in one click.

Utilzing python, I created this awesome application for everyone! Enjoy and give it a try!
